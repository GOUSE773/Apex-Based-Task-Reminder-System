# Apex-Based-Task-Reminder-System
The Apex-Based Task Reminder System automates task follow-ups in Salesforce by sending email reminders for incomplete tasks due today. It runs daily using Scheduled Apex and handles large data with Batch Apex. This system improves productivity by ensuring timely task completion and can be customized for different reminder conditions.

# Key Features
âœ… Automated Email Reminders â€“ Sends email notifications for pending tasks.
âœ… Scheduled Execution â€“ Runs daily at a fixed time using Scheduled Apex.
âœ… Batch Processing â€“ Uses Batch Apex to efficiently process large task lists.
âœ… Test Coverage â€“ Includes a test class to ensure 75%+ code coverage for deployment.
âœ… Scalable & Configurable â€“ Can be modified to handle different reminder conditions (e.g., overdue tasks).

# How It Works
Scheduled Job Execution
The TaskReminderJob runs at a scheduled time (8 AM daily).
Task Query & Filtering
It retrieves all incomplete tasks where the due date is today.
Email Reminder Processing
The system sends an email to the task owner, reminding them to complete the task.
Batch Processing (For Large Data Sets)
If the number of tasks is too large, a Batch Apex class (TaskReminderBatch) processes them in chunks.

# Use Cases
ðŸ“Œ Sales & CRM Teams â€“ Remind sales reps about follow-up tasks.
ðŸ“Œ Project Management â€“ Ensure that assigned tasks are completed on time.
ðŸ“Œ Customer Support â€“ Remind agents about pending customer tickets.
ðŸ“Œ HR & Admin â€“ Notify users about pending approvals or deadlines.

# Technical Implementation
Scheduled Apex (TaskReminderJob) â€“ Runs daily to check pending tasks and send email reminders.
Batch Apex (TaskReminderBatch) â€“ Processes large datasets efficiently.
Test Class (TaskReminderJobTest) â€“ Ensures proper testing and deployment readiness.
Email Notifications â€“ Uses Salesforce's Messaging.SingleEmailMessage to notify task owners.

# Deployment & Customization
Can be deployed using Developer Console, Salesforce CLI (SFDX), or Metadata API.
The scheduled frequency can be adjusted (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
Can be extended to notify via Chatter, SMS, or Push Notifications instead of emails.
This Apex-Based Task Reminder System ensures better task tracking, improved productivity, and timely task completion in Salesforce environments.
